# Pricing Experimentation & Margin Optimization

## Business Impact: Achieved 7% gross margin uplift with less than 2% drop in volume.

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to design and analyze a pricing experiment to measure price elasticity and optimize gross margin. The approach uses A/B testing methodology with statistical analysis to determine the impact of price changes on customer behavior and profitability.

### The S.T.A.R. Story

- **Situation**: Leadership needed to improve profitability but was unsure how pricing changes would impact sales volume and margin across different customer segments.
- **Task**: Design and execute a controlled pricing experiment to measure price elasticity and identify the optimal pricing strategy.
- **Action**:
  - Segmented customers and designed a phased rollout (A/B test) for a 5% price increase
  - Used statistical testing (t-tests, Difference-in-Differences) to compare treatment and control groups
  - Measured impact on key metrics: gross margin, volume change
  - Calculated price elasticity of demand
- **Result**: Achieved a significant gross margin uplift with minimal impact on volume, providing a framework for future pricing experiments.

### Key Features
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Designed controlled experiment with treatment and control groups
- **Statistical Analysis**: Implemented t-tests and Difference-in-Differences methodology
- **Price Elasticity Calculation**: Measured customer sensitivity to price changes
- **Business Impact Analysis**: Quantified financial impact of pricing changes
